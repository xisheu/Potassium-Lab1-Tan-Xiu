              <h1>Roblox</h1>
              <p>The Roblox Corporation developed Roblox, an online gaming platform and game development system that lets users create and play games they've created or those other users have created. 
                 The platform, which was developed in 2004 and launched in 2006 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, features user-generated games of various genres written in the Lua programming language. 
                 In its early years, Roblox was a relatively tiny platform and corporation. In the latter half of the 2010s, Roblox started to develop quickly, and the COVID-19 epidemic aided in its rise.</p>
